# ImagePreprocessingTools
This is a repository for my personal image pre-processing utility tools for ML/DL.

# Util List
- ImageCropper : Crops images into defined output size as many pieces as possible. The default size is 256x256. (See ReadME.md in subdirectory for detail.)
- Videos2Image : Converts multiple videos into images. (See ReadME.md in subdirectory for detail.)
